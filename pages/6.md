Although we can concatenate strings using the `+` operator,

for effiency reasons, 

use the join method to concatenate larger number of strings:

Sometimes printing by concatenation from pieces can be clumsy

```py {monaco-run} {height:'120px'}
a = "first"
b = "second"

print(a + b)
print(" ".join([a, b, b, a]))   # More about the join method later

```

<v-click>

```py

print(str(1) + " plus " + str(3) + " is equal to " + str(4))

print(1, "plus", 3, "is equal to", 4) # slightly better

```

</v-click>
