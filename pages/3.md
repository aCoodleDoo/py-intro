# Arithmetic operations


You can also put arithmetic operations inside a `print` command.

Running it will then print out the result of the operation.

Notice the lack of quotation marks around the arithmetic operations below. 

::right::

```py {monaco-run} {height:'150px'}

print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)

```
