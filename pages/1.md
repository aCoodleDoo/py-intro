# Basic input and output

Let's begin with the `print` command, which prints text.

The traditional `"Hello, world"` program is very simple in Python.

<v-click>

<span v-mark.box.red="1">**Try editing** </span> the string in the quotes and re-running the program.

</v-click>

<v-click>

We need to put the text between <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="3">quotation marks ""</span> to identify it's a string or it <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="3"> will not work. </span>
we will see later what strings are?

</v-click>

```py  {monaco-run} {height:'70px'}

print('Hello, World!')

```
<v-click at='+1'>

```py {monaco-run} {height:'70px'}

print(Hello, World!)

```
</v-click>
