# So, what are strings?

<v-click>

<span v-mark.box.red="1"> **Quotation marks** </span> are used to signify strings.

</v-click>

<v-click>

strings are <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="2"> sequences of characters. </span>

They can consist of <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="3"> letters, numbers </span> and any other types of characters, such as <span v-mark.highlight.yellow="3"> punctuation. </span>

Strings <span v-mark.highlight.red="4"> aren't just words </span>, a single string can be as long as multiple complete sentences.

Strings are usually printed out <span v-mark.highlight.red="5"> exactly as they are written. </span>

Thus, the two commands produce two quite different results

Python <span v-mark.underline.red="6"> does not calculate </span> the result of the operation, but instead <span v-mark.underline.red="6">prints out the operation itself</span> as a string.

</v-click>

::right::

```py {monaco-run} {height:'150px'}

print(2 + 2 * 10)
print("2 + 2 * 10")

```
