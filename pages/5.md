A string is a sequence of characters commonly used to store input or output data in a program.

The characters of a string are specified either between single (') or double (") quotes.

This optionality is useful if, for example, a string needs to contain a quotation mark: `"I don't want to go!"`.

You can also achieve this by escaping the quotation mark with the backslash: `'I don\'t want to go'.`

The string can also contain other escape sequences like `\n` for newline and `\t` for a tabulator.
