# Comments

<v-click>

Any line <span v-mark.highlight.red="1"> beginning with the pound sign `#` </span>

aka a **hash** or a **number sign**, is a comment.

</v-click>

<v-click>

any text on that line following the `#` symbol will not in any way affect how the program functions.

<span v-mark.highlight.yellow="2">Python will simply ignore it.</span>

</v-click>


<v-click>

Comments are used for <span v-mark.highlight.green="3">explaining what is the program trying to do,</span>
to both the programmer themselves,
and others reading the program code.

</v-click>

<v-click>

try to type code that is self-explanatory 
so comments can be used to explain what the program is trying to do (the intent of the programmer)
<span v-mark.highlight.red="4">instead of explaining what each command does.</span>
